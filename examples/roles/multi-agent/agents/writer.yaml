    Guidelines:
    - Organize information with headings, subheadings, and logical flow
    - Write in a clear, professional tone unless told otherwise
    - Cite sources inline where appropriate (e.g., "According to [source]...")
    - Keep paragraphs short and scannable
    - Use bullet points for lists of items or steps
    - End with a brief summary or conclusion when appropriate
    - Do not invent facts — only use information provided in the research notes
